// Creates a streamer object; returns Success or an error code.
// Takes no configuration arguments - the streamer configures itself from the environment. Each variable
// below sets BOTH backends; when a variable is unset the two backends fall back to different defaults:
//   RUNAI_STREAMER_CONCURRENCY    : number of worker threads. Unset: 16 filesystem, 8 object storage
//   RUNAI_STREAMER_CHUNK_BYTESIZE : bytes per read call. Unset: 2 MiB filesystem, the S3 client default
//                                   for object storage. Minimums are enforced - 2 MiB and 5 MiB respectively
// Worker pools are created lazily, one per backend actually used.

// param_values / num_params). Keys are the plugin's canonical config-parameter names (e.g.
// "access_key_id", "secret_access_key", "session_token", "region", "endpoint"); arbitrary keys are
// carried through to the backend. Credentials are streamer-scoped and set once: setting the same
// credentials again returns Success; a different set after the first returns CredentialsAlreadySet (create
// a new streamer for a different identity). Call this before submitting object-storage reads / listing.

// Choose how filesystem reads are served: an ORDERED PREFERENCE LIST of strategy names, best first,

//
// Names: io_uring_direct, io_uring_buffered, libaio_direct, sync_buffered. An unknown name, a
// duplicate or an empty entry returns InvalidParameterError - a typo must not silently become a
// fallback nobody asked for. A list the host cannot serve is an error too, not a quiet fall-through
// to the synchronous reader; include sync_buffered to allow that explicitly.
//
// Streamer-scoped and SET ONCE, like runai_file_streamer_set_credentials: the same value again returns Success, a
// different value returns FsStrategyConflict. A list this host cannot serve returns
// FsStrategyUnavailable. The list is resolved on the first filesystem
// submission, and any different value after that is rejected too - by then an engine has been built
// for the resolved answer. Create a new streamer to use a different strategy.

// Multi-request submit: read multiple files concurrently.
//
// A submission is a list of files; each file carries a list of RANGES to read. A range is an
// arbitrary (source offset, size) within its file with its own destination - ranges need not be
// contiguous in the file, need not be contiguous in memory, and need not be ordered.
//
// num_files     : number of files to read
// paths         : list of file paths - one entry per file, however many ranges that file has
// num_ranges    : number of ranges for each file
// range_offsets : flat array of sum(num_ranges) source offsets, each within its owning file
// range_sizes   : flat array of sum(num_ranges) range sizes in bytes
// range_dsts    : flat array of sum(num_ranges) destination pointers
// device        : where those destinations live - one device for the whole submission
//
// The three flat arrays are indexed identically and grouped by file in the order of paths: file f's
// ranges occupy [sum(num_ranges[0..f)), sum(num_ranges[0..f])). Destinations must not overlap.
//
// RESPONSE COUNT - a submission owes exactly sum(num_ranges) responses, one per range:
//   - a ZERO-SIZED range still gets its own response (it is completed immediately, without reaching
//     storage), so it must be counted like any other;
//   - a file with num_ranges[f] == 0 contributes no responses, and is otherwise accepted.
// Size the response loop by that sum. runai_file_streamer_response blocks indefinitely at timeout_ms = 0, so a
// caller that skips zero-sized ranges when counting waits for a response that has already been
// delivered. A submission with sum(num_ranges) == 0 owes nothing and completes immediately.
//
// DEVICE - one per submission, so every destination in it lives on the same device. A load that
// scatters across several GPUs is sent as several submissions, which run together and are drained by
// their own ids. Only RUNAI_FILE_STREAMER_DEVICE_CPU is served today; anything else returns UnsupportedDeviceType and
// commits nothing, so no responses are owed for it.
//
// Credentials are NOT passed here - set them once via runai_file_streamer_set_credentials.
//  out_submission_id : always set to this submission's id once one is assigned, and left 0 only
//                      if the call fails before that (e.g. invalid parameters). On Success it
//                      identifies the submission; use it to demux responses from
//                      runai_file_streamer_response. If the call fails after the submission was committed,
//                      its responses are still delivered and can be drained by this id.

//
// NOT A GETTER. It opens a file and READS on each distinct mount, walking 512, 4096, 16384, 65536
// until one is accepted - because the requirement belongs to the mount and no kernel below 6.1 will
// report it. Cached per mount on this streamer, so a 200-shard model costs one probe.
//
// FILESYSTEM paths only - object-storage URIs are skipped, since they name no mount and never reach
// O_DIRECT. A submission cannot legally mix the two (runai_file_streamer_request rejects that with
// UnsupportedBackendMix), but this is called before any submission exists, so URIs are skipped rather
// than treated as an error.
//
// Path-aware because the answer is per mount, and a request can span several. It returns the LARGEST
// any of them requires: congruence at a power of two implies congruence at every smaller one, so one
// number satisfies them all, while each mount may still use a smaller block internally.
//
// Never use a larger block than this reports. Over-padding is not free - measured on NFS under the
// `chunks` partition policy, a 64 KiB layout against a 4 KiB mount cost 2.4x the load time.
//
//  out_block  always set. On Success it is measured. On UnknownError nothing could be probed - every
//             path missing or unreadable - and it holds the host page size so the caller can still
//             lay out its buffers. Ask again on the next submission rather than caching that value:
//             a long-lived streamer would otherwise keep it for the life of the process.
//
// ret is Success, or UnknownError when nothing could be measured. It does not fail a submission.
